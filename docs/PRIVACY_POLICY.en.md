# Privacy Policy for Auto Bot Trader i18n (ABTPi18n)

**Last Updated:** [Date]

Welcome to Auto Bot Trader i18n ("ABTPi18n", "we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our platform and services.

By using our service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Personal Identification Information
We may collect personal identification information, such as:
* **Email Address:** To create your account, for login, and for communication.
* **Username:** To identify you within the platform.

### B. Exchange API Keys (Critical Data)
To provide our trading services, we require you to provide API Keys (API Key and API Secret) from third-party exchanges (e.g., Binance, Bybit).
* We **only** request permissions necessary to execute trades and read account balances/history.
* We **do not** request withdrawal permissions via API, and we strongly advise you to disable this permission on the key itself.

### C. Automatically Collected Data
We may automatically collect information about your usage of the service:
* **Log Data:** IP address, browser type, pages visited, and timestamps.
* **Bot & Trade Data:** Strategy configurations, trade logs, PnL data, and error logs generated by your bots.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Your information is used for the following purposes:

* **To Provide and Maintain the Service:** To create your account, run your trading bots, and display your dashboard.
* **To Execute Trades:** Your **Exchange API Keys** are used *exclusively* to send trading orders and read account data from the exchange on your behalf, as instructed by your chosen strategy.
* **To Improve the Service:** We analyze usage data to identify bugs, improve performance, and develop new features.
* **To Communicate With You:** To send security alerts, account notifications, and support messages.

## 3. How We Secure Your Information (Security First)

We implement Omega-Tier security measures to protect your data, especially your API Keys.

* **Encryption at Rest:** Your **API Secret is mandatorily encrypted** (e.g., using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption) *before* it is stored in our database. It is stored in its encrypted form, and the decryption key is managed separately and securely.
* **Encryption in Transit:** All communication between you, our servers, and the exchanges is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
* **Access Control:** We enforce strict internal access controls. Only necessary automated systems (like the bot runner) can request decryption of your key to perform a trade, and this access is heavily logged and audited.
* **User-Side Security:** We strongly recommend and urge all users to **use IP Whitelisting** on their exchange API Keys, limiting access to only our platform's dedicated IP addresses.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your Personal Information or API Keys with third parties for their marketing purposes.

We may disclose your information only in the following limited circumstances:
* **With Your Consent:** If you explicitly authorize us to.
* **To Comply with Laws:** If required by law, subpoena, or other legal process.
* **To Enforce Our Rights:** To protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of ABTPi18n, our users, or the public.

## 5. Data Retention

We will retain your Personal Information and API Keys for as long as your account is active with us. If you delete your account, we will follow a process to delete your data, including encrypted API keys and trade logs, from our production systems.

## 6. Your Rights

You have the right to access, update, or delete your personal information. You can manage your API Keys directly from the settings panel, including adding or revoking them at any time.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
